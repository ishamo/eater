# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

    ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26 revision 54768) [x86_64-linux]

* Rails version

    Rails 5.0.0

* System dependencies

    Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS \n \l

* Configuration


* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


唉，太长了，写不下去，Rails布署实在是太麻烦了。主要是因为就算把代码跑出来，也不能直接丢到生产环境里面，还需要敲不少命令，因为它依赖很多环境，很多gems都需要敲命令才能把环境搞好。不过这是个简单应用。


依赖的环境似乎蛮少的 :(.
